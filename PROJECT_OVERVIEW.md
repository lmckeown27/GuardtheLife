# GuardtheLife - Project Overview

## üéØ Project Vision

GuardtheLife is a comprehensive platform that connects clients in need of lifeguard services with qualified, available lifeguards in real-time. The platform provides location-based matching, secure payment processing, and real-time communication to ensure efficient and reliable lifeguard services.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js + TypeScript + Express**: RESTful API with type safety
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS**: Relational database with spatial capabilities
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication for location updates and service requests
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **JWT**: Secure authentication and authorization
- **Stripe**: Payment processing and management
- **Firebase**: Authentication and push notifications

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Native + TypeScript**: Cross-platform mobile application
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management
- **React Navigation**: Navigation and routing
- **React Native Maps**: Location services and mapping
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time communication
- **Stripe React Native SDK**: Payment integration

## üîë Core Features

### 1. Dual Role System
- **Client Role**: Request services, track lifeguards, make payments
- **Lifeguard Role**: Set availability, receive requests, manage schedule

### 2. Real-time Location Services
- GPS tracking for both clients and lifeguards
- PostGIS spatial queries for efficient location-based searches
- Real-time location updates via Socket.IO

### 3. Smart Matching Algorithm
- Find closest available lifeguard based on location
- Consider availability, ratings, and certifications
- Real-time matching and notification

### 4. Booking & Service Management
- Service request creation and management
- Status tracking (pending, accepted, in-progress, completed)
- Service history and analytics

### 5. Payment Processing
- Secure Stripe integration
- Multiple payment methods
- Automated invoicing and receipts
- Refund processing

### 6. Communication & Notifications
- Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications
- In-app messaging system
- Real-time status updates
- Service reminders and confirmations

### 7. Quality Assurance
- Rating and review system
- Certification verification
- Background check integration
- Service quality metrics

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables
1. **users**: User profiles and authentication
2. **lifeguards**: Lifeguard-specific information and availability
3. **user_locations**: GPS coordinates with PostGIS spatial data
4. **service_requests**: Service bookings and status tracking
5. **payments**: Financial transactions and Stripe integration
6. **ratings**: User feedback and quality metrics
7. **notifications**: Push notification management

### Key Relationships
- Users can have multiple roles (client/lifeguard)
- Service requests link clients and lifeguards
- Payments are tied to service requests
- Ratings are associated with completed services
- Locations are updated in real-time

## üîê Security Features

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Secure payment processing
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR compliance considerations

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Docker Compose for local development
- Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
- Local PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- Redis for caching and sessions

### Production Environment
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Load balancing and auto-scaling
- Database clustering and replication
- CDN for static assets
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

## üì± Mobile App Features

### Client App
- User registration and authentication
- Service request creation
- Real-time lifeguard tracking
- Payment management
- Service history and ratings
- Push notifications

### Lifeguard App
- Profile management and availability toggle
- Service request notifications
- Navigation to client locations
- Service completion and reporting
- Earnings tracking
- Schedule management

## üîß Development Workflow

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 14+ with PostGIS
- React Native development environment

### Setup Process
1. Clone repository and run `./install.sh`
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up Firebase and Stripe accounts
4. Run database migrations
5. Start development servers

### Development Commands
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && npm run dev

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm start
